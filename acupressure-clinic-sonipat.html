Acupressure doesnt force the body; it invites it to shift gears—from tense to calm, from guarded to open. Many clients describe feeling lighter and clearer immediately after a session.</p><div class="grid cols-3"><div class="card"><h3 class="h3">Headache & Migraine</h3><p>We use points known to relieve head and neck tension while encouraging slow, deep breaths.

These self-care tools empower you to influence symptoms between visits without relying on medication.</p></div></section><section class="section reveal"><div class="container"><h2 class="h2">What a session feels like</h2><p>We begin by understanding your symptoms and daily rhythms: sleep, meals, activity, and stress. You lie comfortably while the practitioner applies steady, mindful pressure to specific points. Many people feel a wave of relaxation, warmth in the limbs, or ease in breathing. Some nap. After the session, we suggest a simple routine—hydration, a short walk, and a minute of slow breathing—to extend the benefits.</p><p>Acupressure is generally safe, including for seniors. We avoid certain points during pregnancy and adapt for medical conditions. If something feels uncomfortable, we change technique immediately.
