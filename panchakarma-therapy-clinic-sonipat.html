At Healing Power Clinic, we offer authentic care—thoughtfully paced, hygienic, and tailored to your goals—so you can feel lighter, clearer, and more resilient.</p><div class="feature" style="margin:18px 0"><div><p>We begin with a careful consultation to understand digestion, sleep, energy, skin, joints, stress, and current medications. We clarify your <em>prakriti</em> (constitution) and <em>vikriti</em> (current imbalance), then plan <em>purva karma</em> (preparatory care): <em>Snehana</em> (medicated oiling) and <em>Swedana</em> (steam). Depending on your needs, we may recommend one or more of the five karmas:</p><ul class="list"><li><strong>Vamana</strong> (therapeutic emesis): To clear excess Kapha—useful in chronic congestion and certain skin concerns.</li><li><strong>Virechana</strong> (therapeutic purgation): To pacify Pitta and support liver and gut cleansing.</li><li><strong>Basti</strong> (medicated enema): To balance Vata; very effective for joint pain, dryness, and nervous system rest.</li><li><strong>Nasya</strong> (nasal therapy): For sinus, headache, and mental clarity.</li><li><strong>Raktamokshana</strong> (bloodletting): Offered selectively where indicated.</li></ul><p>We integrate <em>Abhyanga</em>, <em>Shirodhara</em>, and <em>Udvartana</em> when beneficial. Your diet is guided with easy recipes and clear do/don’t lists, and we adjust intensity based on your feedback.</p></div><div class="illus"><img loading="lazy" src="assets/posters/healing-power-panchakarma-scope.svg" alt="Panchakarma scope"></div></div><h2 class="h2">Who benefits from Panchakarma?</h2><p>People with sluggish digestion, bloating, skin issues, brain fog, joint stiffness, stress overload, or persistent fatigue often feel significant change. Many combine Panchakarma with physiotherapy to support joint recovery and movement retraining.</p><h2 class="h2">Program length & expectations</h2><p>Depending on your goals and health status, programs range from short, focused protocols (7–10 days) to deeper resets (14–21 days). We set realistic expectations and follow up to maintain gains through routines and herbal support.</p><h2 class="h2">FAQs</h2><div class="faq"><h3 class="h3">What should I eat during Panchakarma?</h3><p>We usually begin with light, warm, easily digestible meals—such as kitchari—then tailor based on constitution. Hydration, timing, and sleep rhythms are part of the plan.</p></div><div class="faq"><h3 class="h3">Is Panchakarma safe for seniors?</h3><p>Yes, with careful screening and appropriate intensity. We pace gently and monitor closely.</p></div><div class="faq"><h3 class="h3">How much does Panchakarma cost?</h3><p>Costs depend on duration, procedures, and oils/herbs used. We maintain transparent pricing and never compromise on hygiene or quality.</p></div><div class="actions" style="margin-top:18px"><a class="btn gold" href="/contact.html#book">Book Panchakarma consult</a><a class="btn btn-outline" href="/ayurvedic-treatment-sonipat.html">Explore Ayurveda</a></div></div></section><!-- SEO: Expanded Panchakarma longform copy to exceed 1000 words and strengthen topical authority --><section class="section reveal"><div class="container"><h2 class="h2">Understanding Panchakarma in modern life</h2><p>Panchakarma is not a crash detox. It is a staged medical program that helps the body unburden gently while improving digestion, sleep, and mental clarity. The first step is always assessment: constitution (prakriti), current imbalance (vikriti), and suitability. We clarify your goals—lighter digestion, calmer skin, joint comfort, steadier energy—and design a plan that fits work, family, and travel. We aim for progress, not extremes; safe rituals done consistently create change you can feel.</p><h2 class="h2">Purva karma: prepare the body</h2><p>Preparation includes <strong>Snehana</strong> (internal and external oleation) and <strong>Swedana</strong> (therapeutic steam). Snehana lubricates tissues and draws impurities toward the gut for elimination. Swedana opens channels and relaxes guarding, which is why many people sleep better almost immediately. We adjust oils and temperature to your constitution, and we teach simple home practices—warm water, gentle walks, earlier dinners—that reinforce results.</p><h2 class="h2">The five karmas, applied judiciously</h2><ul class="list"><li><strong>Vamana</strong>: reserved for Kapha-dominant states such as chronic congestion or certain skin presentations. Performed with medical screening and post-care supervision.</li><li><strong>Virechana</strong>: supports the liver–gut axis and helps pacify Pitta. We pace dosing to protect comfort and electrolytes.</li><li><strong>Basti</strong>: the cornerstone for Vata imbalance. Medicated enemas can transform dryness, joint stiffness, constipation, and sleep disturbance.</li><li><strong>Nasya</strong>: nasal therapy for sinus health, headaches, and mental clarity—often combined with neck/shoulder relaxation.</li><li><strong>Raktamokshana</strong>: used selectively for indications such as localized congestion. Safety and hygiene are paramount.</li></ul><p>Not everyone needs all five. In most real-world cases we combine Basti and Nasya with supportive therapies like Abhyanga, Shirodhara, and Udvartana.</p><h2 class="h2">Program timeline & after-care</h2><p>We offer focused 7–10 day programs and deeper 14–21 day resets. After the active phase, <em>paschat karma</em> (after-care) consolidates gains: light, warm meals; gentle movement; and graded return to usual routines. We share clear food lists and simple recipes, and we check in to adjust herbs based on response.</p><h2 class="h2">Who benefits</h2><p>People with sluggish digestion, bloating, skin reactivity, brain fog, joint stiffness, or stress overload often notice meaningful shifts. For orthopedic concerns, Panchakarma pairs beautifully with physiotherapy: calmer tissues sleep better and tolerate strengthening work sooner.</p><h2 class="h2">Safety first</h2><p>We screen carefully for age, comorbidities, and medications. Intensity is personalized; we will never push procedures inappropriate for your context. Hygiene, temperature, and privacy are meticulously maintained. We coordinate with your physician when appropriate.</p><div class="actions" style="margin-top:18px"><a class="btn gold" href="/contact.html#book">Plan your Panchakarma</a><a class="btn btn-outline" href="/ayurvedic-treatment-sonipat.html">Consult Ayurveda</a></div><p class="seo-links">Explore authentic <a href="/panchakarma-therapy-clinic-sonipat.html">Panchakarma therapy Sonipat</a> guided by an experienced <a href="/ayurvedic-treatment-sonipat.html">Ayurvedic doctor Sonipat</a>.
