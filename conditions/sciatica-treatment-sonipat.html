At Healing Power Clinic, we use precise physiotherapy, calming acupressure, and supportive Ayurveda to reduce nerve irritation and restore confident movement.</p></div></section><section class="section reveal"><div class="container"><h2 class="h2">What is sciatica?</h2><p>“Sciatica” refers to pain along the sciatic nerve pathway, usually felt in the buttock, back of the thigh, or calf. It may be sharp, burning, or electric; sometimes it alternates with numbness or weakness. The most common causes include a disc bulge or herniation, narrowing of the spinal canal (stenosis), or irritation where the nerve exits the spine. Less commonly, it may be irritated by surrounding muscles or sensitive neural tissue after a period of prolonged stress or inactivity.</p><p>Good news: most sciatica improves with thoughtful, progressive care. Imaging is sometimes helpful, but we prioritize a careful clinical assessment to identify your drivers and select the safest, most effective starting point.</p></div></section><section class="section light reveal"><div class="container"><h2 class="h2">Our step-by-step plan</h2><ol class="list"><li><strong>Assess & explain:</strong> We map your symptoms, test movements, check nerve tension, and identify aggravating postures. You’ll understand what’s happening and why certain positions flare pain.</li><li><strong>Calm irritation:</strong> Positions of relief, gentle nerve glides, manual therapy, and taping when useful. Acupressure points help reduce guarding and promote relaxation for better sleep.</li><li><strong>Restore motion:</strong> Hip and spine mobility drills that respect your tolerance. We progress from symptom-free arcs to functional ranges.</li><li><strong>Rebuild strength:</strong> Core and glute conditioning with gradual loading. We add balance and coordination to reduce re-irritation.</li><li><strong>Return to life:</strong> We plan sitting breaks, lifting strategies, and walk progressions so you can work and play without fear.</li></ol><p>Where helpful, Ayurvedic routines support digestion and sleep—two pillars that accelerate tissue recovery and calm the nervous system.</p></div></section><section class="section reveal"><div class="container"><h2 class="h2">Home tips for the first week</h2><ul class="list"><li>Sit back in the chair with hips slightly higher than knees; use a cushion for support.</li><li>Change position every 30–45 minutes; walk for 2–3 minutes when possible.</li><li>Use short, gentle movements rather than stretching aggressively into pain.</li><li>Prioritize sleep: wind down with warm showers, light meals, and slow breathing.</li></ul><div class="card" style="margin-top:14px"><h3 class="h3">Red flags (seek medical advice)</h3><p>New bowel or bladder changes, progressive leg weakness, fever with back pain, or significant trauma.

Complex cases may require longer, but we track progress and adjust.</p></div><div class="faq"><h3 class="h3">Do I need an MRI?</h3><p>Not always. We recommend imaging only when red flags, severe weakness, or lack of progress suggest it will change management.</p></div><div class="faq"><h3 class="h3">Can I exercise?</h3><p>Yes—appropriately.

Common drivers include a disc bulge, age-related spinal changes, or sensitized neural tissue after periods of stress, illness, or inactivity. Our goal is to identify your main driver and dose movement in a way that calms rather than flares.</p><h2 class="h2">Relief first: positions and pacing</h2><ul class="list"><li>Find your position of ease (for some, slightly arched; for others, gently flexed). Use it for 1	6 minute intervals through the day.</li><li>Short, frequent movement beats long, infrequent stretching. Aim for 2	4-minute walk breaks.</li><li>Use heat to calm protective muscle guarding; reserve intense stretching for later phases.</li></ul><h2 class="h2">Restore motion: gentle nerve health</h2><p>Nerve glides (sliders) can reduce sensitivity when dosed kindly. We start with tiny, pain-free arcs and progress only when symptoms allow. Mobility for hips and mid-back reduces strain on the lower back so your system feels safer.</p><h2 class="h2">Rebuild strength: capacity protects</h2><p>We strengthen glutes, trunk, and legs with graded loading. This improves tissue tolerance, reduces flare frequency, and brings back confidence to lift, sit, and travel. Strength is your long-term safety net.</p><h2 class="h2">Sleep, stress, and digestion</h2><p>Nerves calm faster with good sleep and steady meals. Simple Ayurvedic routines (warm meals, regular timing) and acupressure for relaxation can speed recovery by reducing overall irritability.</p><div class="card"><h3 class="h3">Myths we clear up</h3><p>You dont need to avoid bending forever. Youll learn to hinge safely, then layer capacity so daily life feels normal again.</p></div><h2 class="h2">When to image / see a doctor</h2><p>New bowel/bladder changes, severe/progressive weakness, fever with back pain, cancer history, or significant trauma warrant medical review. Otherwise, a clinical plan is the best first step.</p><h2 class="h2">Your home plan (first 2 weeks)</h2><ul class="list"><li>2	3 walk breaks daily, 2	4 minutes each.</li><li>2 gentle mobility snacks (hips, mid-back) and one nerve slider session within comfort.</li><li>Evening wind-down: warm shower, light meal, slow breathing for 2 minutes.</li></ul><div class="actions" style="margin-top:18px"><a class="btn gold" href="/contact.html#book">Start a sciatica plan</a><a class="btn btn-outline" href="/conditions/slip-disc-treatment-sonipat.html">Related: Slip Disc</a></div></div></section><!-- End expanded Sciatica copy --></main><aside class="section light"><div class="container"><div class="grid cols-3"><div class="card"><h3 class="h3">Related services</h3><p><a href="/physiotherapy-clinic-sonipat.html">Physiotherapy</a> for graded loading; <a href="/acupressure-clinic-sonipat.html">Acupressure</a> for calming; <a href="/ayurvedic-treatment-sonipat.html">Ayurveda</a> for sleep and digestion support.</p></div><div class="card"><h3 class="h3">Related conditions</h3><p><a href="/conditions/slip-disc-treatment-sonipat.html">Slip Disc</a>, <a href="/conditions/lumbar-spondylosis-treatment-sonipat.html">Lumbar Spondylosis</a>, <a href="/conditions/knee-pain-arthritis-treatment-sonipat.html">Knee Arthritis</a>.</p></div><div class="card"><h3 class="h3">Return-to-life plan</h3><p>We’ll help you sit, lift, and walk without fear.
