If you’ve tried rest and painkillers without lasting change, it’s time for a structured plan that builds resilience week by week.</p><h2 class="h2">Your first session: clear, calm, and actionable</h2><p>We start with a thorough assessment: history, movement screen, joint and muscle tests, and where needed, special tests to rule out red flags. You’ll understand the drivers of your pain and a step-by-step plan to change them. We begin treatment the same day and give you one or two simple practices to do at home—not a long list.</p><div class="card"><h3 class="h3">Common conditions we treat</h3><p>Back and neck pain, sciatica, slip disc, knee pain/arthritis, frozen shoulder, shoulder impingement, plantar fasciitis, tennis elbow, post-operative rehab (ACL, meniscus, rotator cuff), and more.

We check how you move and how your symptoms behave under gentle, safe tests. For nerve-related pain, we use careful sliders and tensioners only within comfort. For joint and soft-tissue concerns, we look at mobility, strength, control, and posture habits. Then we prioritize the two or three biggest levers that will create change this week.</p><h2 class="h2">Back pain & sciatica roadmap</h2><p>We calm irritation first—with positions of ease, manual therapy where helpful, and simple home drills. Then we rebuild hip and trunk capacity with graded loading. Education is key: you’ll learn when to push and when to pause. For sciatica, nerve health improves when movement is dosed kindly and sleep gets better—two levers we focus on.</p><h2 class="h2">Knee arthritis pathway</h2><p>We combine activity modification, taping, and progressive strengthening for quadriceps, hips, and calves. We practice stairs, sit-to-stand, and floor transfers so life gets easier quickly. Footwear and pacing strategies reduce day-to-day spikes. Ayurveda supports weight, sleep, and digestion—quiet drivers of knee comfort.</p><h2 class="h2">Post-surgery rehabilitation</h2><p>After ACL, meniscus, or rotator cuff procedures, we use phased protocols: swelling control, range, strength, and return-to-function. We coordinate with your surgeon’s guidance and keep you motivated with measurable milestones.</p><h2 class="h2">Home physiotherapy (limited radius)</h2><p>When needed, we provide home visits within our service radius. We bring the same clarity and structure to your space and teach caregivers safe support techniques.</p><div class="actions" style="margin-top:18px"><a class="btn gold" href="/contact.html#book">Start physiotherapy</a><a class="btn btn-outline" href="/conditions/sciatica-treatment-sonipat.html">See Sciatica pathway</a></div><p class="seo-links">We offer evidence-led <a href="/physiotherapy-clinic-sonipat.html">physiotherapy treatment Sonipat</a> delivered by an experienced <a href="/physiotherapy-clinic-sonipat.html">physiotherapy doctor Sonipat</a>.
