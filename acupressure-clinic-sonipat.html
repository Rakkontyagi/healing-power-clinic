Its non-invasive, relaxing, and pairs beautifully with physiotherapy and Ayurveda.</p></div></section><section class="section reveal"><div class="container"><h2 class="h2">What acupressure helps</h2><p>We commonly support headaches and migraines, neck stiffness, back pain, knee osteoarthritis, plantar fasciitis, tennis elbow, and stress-related symptoms like poor sleep or jaw clenching. Acupressure doesnt force the body; it invites it to shift gears—from tense to calm, from guarded to open. Many clients describe feeling lighter and clearer immediately after a session.</p><div class="grid cols-3"><div class="card"><h3 class="h3">Headache & Migraine</h3><p>We use points known to relieve head and neck tension while encouraging slow, deep breaths.

Stimulating small, specific areas can influence distant regions like the spine, shoulder, or knee. We use seeds, magnets, or soft tools with gentle pressure. This approach is particularly helpful for people who prefer very light touch or who are sensitive to direct work on painful areas.</p><p>In your session, well teach you a few safe points you can use at home for short periods. These self-care tools empower you to influence symptoms between visits without relying on medication.</p></div></section><section class="section reveal"><div class="container"><h2 class="h2">What a session feels like</h2><p>We begin by understanding your symptoms and daily rhythms: sleep, meals, activity, and stress. You lie comfortably while the practitioner applies steady, mindful pressure to specific points. Many people feel a wave of relaxation, warmth in the limbs, or ease in breathing. Some nap. After the session, we suggest a simple routine—hydration, a short walk, and a minute of slow breathing—to extend the benefits.</p><p>Acupressure is generally safe, including for seniors. We avoid certain points during pregnancy and adapt for medical conditions. If something feels uncomfortable, we change technique immediately. Your comfort leads the way.</p></div></section><section class="section light reveal"><div class="container"><h2 class="h2">FAQs</h2><div class="faq"><h3 class="h3">How many sessions do I need?</h3><p>Acute headaches or neck tightness may improve within two to four sessions.

Acupressure invites a shift toward safety via slow, steady input at specific points. This improves circulation, releases guarded tissue, and quiets sensitivity without needles or force. Many people describe a sense of warmth, clarity, and relaxation that lingers after sessions. Over time, these sessions make movement practice and daily loading more comfortable.</p><h2 class="h2">Sujok mapping: hands and feet as a toolkit</h2><p><em>Sujok</em> maps the body onto the hands and feet.
